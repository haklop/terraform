# remote-exec Provisioner

The `remote-exec` provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it
is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap
into a cluster, etc. To invoke a local process, see the `local-exec`
[provisioner](/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html) instead. The `remote-exec`
provisioner only supports `ssh` type [connections](/docs/provisioners/connection.html).


## Example usage

```
# Run puppet and join our Consul cluster
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ...
    provisioner "remote-exec" {
        inline = [
        "puppet apply",
        "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}"
        ]
    }
}
```
